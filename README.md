# Retail-Customer-Clustering
This project uses the Mall Customer Dataset to implement a K-means clustering algorithm that groups retail store customers based on their purchase history. The clustering is performed using key features like annual income and spending score, enabling better customer segmentation and targeted marketingÂ strategies.
